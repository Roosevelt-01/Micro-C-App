#### PLA
Highest tensile strength cheap EASY TO PRINT, low temp resistance, brittle, a lot stronger than most people give it credit for.

[Inland 1.75mm Black PLA](search=407452)

#### PLA+
Same print settings as PLA more or less more impact resistant less tensile strength a bit more flex to it.

[Inland 1.75mm Black PLA+](search=989269)

#### PETG
The same material they make water bottles out of; flexible, higher temp resistance than PLA, aromatic (doesnt break down with gamma radiation) likes to string, pulls in water quicker than PLA.

#### ABS
Difficult to print, high temp resistance but unless printed perfectly usually weaker than PLA.

BREAKS DOWN IN SUNLIGHT.

[Inland 1.75mm Black ABS](search=407593)

#### ASA
Chemically very similar to ABS slightly higher temp resistance than ABS slightly easier to print doesnt break down in sunlight more expensive than ABS.

#### Polycarbonate
Same material bullet proof glass is made from (mostly theyre coated in pvb too which is another printable thermoplastic!) Just about as high of a tensile strenth as PLA with a much higher temp resistance than ABS, very difficult to print.

Most stock printers WILL NOT safely print this without heavy modifications

#### Nylon
Same material toothbrush bristles are made off, VERY impact resistant, self lubricating (great for gears!) often used as a base for carbon fibers and glass infusions because of its obscene layer adhesion, printability is incredibly dependant on brand and type of nylon (PA 2, PA2.2, PA6, PA6.6, PA22, PA66, and CoPA (pa6.6 and pa 22 copolymer)) absorbs water quickly though. Three hour shelf life unless printed from a humidity controlled enviroment.

#### Polypropylene(PP)
Non-bioreactive, incredibly flexible, and prints... weirdly? needs a really low temperature (180) and requires you use clear packing tape on your build platform for it to stick.  Great for aquaponics, medical implants, living hinges, and any need for a semiflexible structure.

#### TPU/TPE
Flexible, difficult to print, turn off your retraction and lower your speeds

[Inland 1.75mm Black TPU](search=973271)

#### PETG+
Slightly higher temp resistance a bit more impact resistant less gummy and susceptible to errors while printing fast and has a longer shelf life (plus a considerable higher margin rate)

#### Lite PLA
Essentially matte fiber pla, God awful on the strength side of things but looks pretty and should be fully compostable?

[Inland 1.75mm Black Lite PLA](search=141416)

#### Glass PLA Translucent PLA
Prints similarly to the silks, except a bit on the brittle side

[Inland 1.75mm Glass Purple PLA](search=120782)

#### TWINKLING PLA
Very high glitter content pla composite, its shiny, its pretty ✨
